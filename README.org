* Usage

Emacsism relies on the ~excersism-cli~ package to be installed.
When emacsism activated ~emacsism-mode~ it checks installation and if missing
runs an error. To install ~exercsims-cli~ got to
https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough

Once installed and required emacsism provide this functions:

  - ~emacsism-url-download-and-open~: Download and open ~Readme.md~ file from
    the URL, example: ~(emacsism-url-download-and-open "URL")~ the function is
    interactive so with: ~M-x emacsism-url-download-and-open~ it asks for the URL.
  - ~emacsism-download-and-open~: Interactive function that ask for the track
    and exercise to download and open ~Readme.md~ file.

  - ~emacsism-find-exercise~: Ask for the track and exercise that already been
    downloaded and open the README.md file of exercise.

  - ~emacsism-test~: Also an interactive function that, when called from a file
    inside the exercise directory, it will run the exercise tests.

* Containers.

When ~emacsism-container-command~ is present, as ~"podman"~ or ~"docker"~ or
similar but not ~nil~. The tests will run in a container named ~emacsism-track~ where the ~track~ is
the name of the exercise track. For example, in a rust exercise, a container
~emacsism-rust~ musts exist, and it will run the ~cargo test~ command for the
current exercise.

To build container images for a track function ~emacsism-build-container~ uses
~emacsism-container-command~
